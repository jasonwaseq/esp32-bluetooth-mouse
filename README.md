# esp32-bluetooth-mouse

I developed a Bluetooth-enabled mouse using an ESP32-C3 microcontroller and an ICM-42670-P inertial measurement unit (IMU). The project involved programming the ESP32 to detect tilt movements through accelerometer data and translate them into corresponding cursor movements on a connected computer via Bluetooth HID. I first implemented directional detection logic to print tilt directions (e.g., “UP LEFT”) using ESP_LOGI, then integrated Bluetooth functionality to move the mouse on-screen. Finally, I combined both systems to create a responsive motion-based mouse control with multi-level acceleration based on tilt intensity and duration. This required careful calibration of thresholds, timing, and speed scaling to achieve smooth and accurate cursor movement. The completed system successfully demonstrated real-time tilt-based mouse control, showcasing embedded systems design, Bluetooth communication, and sensor data processing skills.
